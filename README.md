Some html games

Double-click index.html or so-and-so in the root directory.html can run immediately
Some projects can be run directly, and some projects require opening their root folder and finding their main program file to run.Json files are game configuration files. After opening the game, please click "Select Configuration" to select levels. Manual configuration files are written in Json, so you can also learn to write them yourself to customize levels

you can use them to play like shoot game or 2Djump
However, these project pages only support Chinese (including comments in the text) and you also can use them to learning and the picture is also free
